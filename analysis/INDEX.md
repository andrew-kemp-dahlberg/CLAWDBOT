# 30_analysis/

**The interpretive layer. Reasoning recorded.**

This is where we think out loud. Hypotheses under investigation. Arguments with their premises visible. Questions we haven't answered yet.

Analysis is the bridge between evidence and belief. It's supposed to be messy.

## Why This Layer Matters

Most bullshit happens in the gap between evidence and conclusion.

Someone shows you evidence. Someone tells you a conclusion. The reasoning that connects them? Hidden. Assumed. Or worse - nonexistent.

This layer makes the reasoning visible. If we conclude X, you can see *why* we concluded X. If the reasoning is bad, you can catch it.

## The Test

Can you follow the reasoning from evidence to conclusion?

If not, something's missing. Either the evidence isn't solid, or the inference is hidden, or the conclusion doesn't follow.

Analysis makes it checkable.
