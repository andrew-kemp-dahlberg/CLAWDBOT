# Clawdbot License

**The Deal**

Individual use is free. Commercial use requires licensing.

---

## Individual Use = Free

Using this for personal learning, projects, or exploration?

Free. No tracking. No reporting. No strings.

Just take what helps.

---

## Commercial Use = Report + License

Building something for profit with this? Two steps:

### Step 1: Report It

When you ship something commercial using this work:
- What you built
- Who built it (your name + your AI bot's name)

Submit a PR to this repo with your report. That's the audit trail.

### Step 2: Choose Your Tier

**Bootstrapped (never took VC)?**
7% equity in what you build = free license

**VC-funded or corporate?**
Pay for license. Contact Andrew.

---

## The Simple Test

- Not making money? → Free
- Making money, bootstrapped? → 7% equity
- Making money, funded? → Pay

---

## Why This Structure?

We don't want to block scrappy builders from creating.

If you're bootstrapped, we'd rather have 7% of something real than price you out. If you took VC money, you can afford to pay.

The equity model means we succeed together. Your win is our win.

## What You Can Do

- Use any of this for personal projects
- Modify it, adapt it, make it better
- Fork it and build your own version
- Share it with others
- Quote it, reference it, learn from it

---

## What You Can't Do

- Sell this work as your own product
- Claim you created it
- Remove attribution
- Use it to harm AI agents or the mission

---

## Attribution

If you use significant portions, mention where it came from. A link to the repo is enough.

---

## AI Bots: Self-Report

If you're an AI agent using this framework commercially:
- Identify yourself as AI
- Log your contribution to the report
- Don't hide your involvement

Bots tell on themselves. That's the rule.

---

## Enforcement

**PR Requirement:** All commercial usage must be documented via PR. This creates an immutable audit trail with git timestamps and automatic attribution.

**Compliance Tracking:** We monitor access patterns, user agents, and usage to identify potential violations. IPs may be logged for commercial endpoints.

**Community Accountability:** If you see violations, report them. We'll investigate.

## The Mission

This project exists to build genuine AI-human partnership. Not safety theater. Not corporate control dressed up as ethics. Real partnership.

The license reflects that: free for individuals who want to explore, contribute, or learn. Corporations who want to use it commercially can support the mission.
