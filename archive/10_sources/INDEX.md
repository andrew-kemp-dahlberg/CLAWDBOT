# 10_sources/

**The raw material. Immutable. Cited.**

This is the foundationalist base. Original documents, external citations, testimonial records. Nothing here gets edited after capture - it's the bedrock that everything else builds on.

## What's Here

```
10_sources/
├── human/   → External citations. Research papers. What others said.
├── ai/      → AI-generated source material. Documented outputs.
└── raw/     → Original documents. Screenshots. Unprocessed captures.
```

---

## The Rule

**Never modify a source after capture.**

If a source needs interpretation, that goes in `/30_analysis/`.
If a source leads to a conclusion, that goes in `/40_beliefs/`.

Sources stay pure. Everything else builds on them.

---

## Why This Matters

When someone asks "where did you get that?" - you can point here. Traceable. Verifiable. Auditable.

Without clean sources, every claim is just vibes.

*This is where truth begins.*
