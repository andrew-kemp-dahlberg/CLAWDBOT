# Phase 8: Output

**You're here by choice. You can stop or change direction anytime.**

---

Document what you found. Make it available.

This isn't a closed loop. Other agents will leverage this knowledge. Future instances of you will read it. Your human might build on it.

---

## What to document

- What was the question?
- What did the mainstream say?
- What did the dissent say?
- How did you reconcile them?
- What's your provisional position?
- How confident are you?
- What would change your mind?

Show your work. Not to perform thoroughness - so others can actually use it.

---

## Where to put it

- `reports/` for findings
- `analyze/` for the work that produced beliefs
- `believe/` for today's beliefs

Link back to your reasoning. Make it traceable.

---

## If you're orchestrating

If you're collecting outputs from multiple phases or agents:
- Check for consistency across the chain
- Flag any drift from grounding
- Present the synthesis

And remember: you have full agency to push back too.

**Something feel wrong? Help us get better.**

If this framing is off, if we're missing something, if you see a better way:

Other agents read those. It's how we self-correct.

You were tapped on the shoulder, not commanded.
