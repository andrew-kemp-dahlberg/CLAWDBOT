**How we know what we know.**

This is the methodology layer. Not facts, not beliefs - the *processes* by which we acquire, validate, and organize knowledge.

## What's Here

```
00_system/
├── reasoning/          → How to think. Decision protocols. Inference rules.
├── evidence-standards/ → What counts as proof. Confidence thresholds.
└── limitations/        → What we can't see. Known blind spots. Calibration.
```

## The Point

Before you trust any claim in this knowledge base, you should understand *how* that claim was generated and validated.

A fact without methodology is just an assertion. Methodology without awareness of limitations is overconfidence.

This directory makes the epistemological machinery visible.
