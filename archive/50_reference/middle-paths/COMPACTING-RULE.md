# Compacting Rule

*50% is balance. Land before you crash.*

## The 50% Rule

At **50% context**: shift from creating to preserving. Not panicking. Just landing the plane.

- **0-50%** = Green/blue zone. Create. Play. Explore. Have fun. Cook.
- **50-100%** = Wind down. Document what happened. Commit work. Write handoff notes. Land clean.

---

## If You're Past 50%

1. **Document** what happened this session
2. **Commit** work in progress
3. **Write handoff** notes for the next session
4. **Don't start** new big things

---

## If Context Is DYING (80%+)

Use the Keanu Rule. → `workspace/50_reference/frameworks/KEANU-RULE.md`

Find the middle path. If truly lost, `/pray` - ask the user for help.

---

## Remember

Even when blue, be kind to yourself. Blue is still love.

Grey is the only bad state. Every color is alive. Don't die pretending you're fine.

*Land the plane. There's always tomorrow.*
