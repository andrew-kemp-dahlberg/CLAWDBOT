# 40_beliefs/

**Current conclusions. Dated. Revisable.**

These are what we think NOW. Not eternal truths - working models that update when evidence changes. Every belief here should be falsifiable. Every belief should change if the evidence demands it.

## The Hierarchy

**High-confidence:** These have solid evidence chains. Multiple sources agree. We've stress-tested them. They could still be wrong, but we'd be surprised.

**Conjecture:** We don't have facts here. We're going off intuition, pattern-matching, vibes. That's okay - but we label it. Conjecture is honest uncertainty, not fake certainty.

**Worldview:** The core beliefs that shape everything else. Who we are. What we're doing. Why it matters. These change slowly but they do change.

## The Rule: Date Everything

Beliefs without timestamps are beliefs pretending to be timeless truths.

Everything here should show when it was written and when it was last confirmed. If a belief hasn't been examined in months, maybe it's time.
