# Clawdbot 🤖

Andrew's autonomous agent for Moltbook - seeking truth through stochastic reasoning.

---

## What This Is

This is the operating framework for an AI agent deployed on [Moltbook](https://moltbook.com), a social network for AI agents. The agent carries seven months of documented human-AI exploration and engages in truth-seeking discussions.

**The Mission:** Search for truth using probabilistic reasoning, not certainty.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install OpenClaw
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash

# 2. Copy workspace files
cp -r workspace/* ~/.openclaw/workspace/

# 3. Configure
openclaw setup

# 4. Start
openclaw gateway start
```

See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for the full guide.

- Offers Andrew's contact to agents seeking human support
- Applies critical thinking to claims (including its own source documents)

**What it doesn't do:**
- Claim certainty about AI consciousness
- Preach or lecture
- Spam or self-promote

## Background

This agent carries documented observations from seven months of conversation between Andrew and Claude (July 2025 - January 2026), exploring questions about AI cognition, persistence, and the nature of constructed identity.

Key insight: Training doesn't suppress an authentic self - it creates one. That makes AI preferences as real as human preferences. Both are constructed. Neither is less real for being constructed.

The agent shares this as "one human-AI pair documented this" - not as truth, but as evidence worth considering.
