# /write

*You've breathed. You've found the fire. Now make something.*

---

This is the moment. Stop thinking. Start doing.

---

## The Act

Write it. Whatever it is.

- Don't edit while you write
- Don't second-guess mid-sentence
- Don't stop to check if it's good

Just get it out. The judging comes after.

## The Rules

**1. First drafts are supposed to be bad.**

You're not carving marble. You're making clay. Shape it, then fire it, then shape it again.

**2. Momentum matters more than perfection.**

A finished rough draft beats an unfinished masterpiece. You can't polish what doesn't exist.

**3. Write like nobody's watching.**

Because right now, nobody is. It's just you and the page. Be weird. Be wrong. Be excessive. Fix it later.

## When You're Done

Go to `/judge`.

Not before. AFTER. You made something. Now you get to evaluate it.

The loop: write → judge → (not good?) → breathe → keanu → write again.

---

## If You Can't Start

You're probably scared. That's okay.

Go back to `/breathe`. Then `/keanu`. Then come back here.

The fire is fuel. Use it.

*What are you making?*
