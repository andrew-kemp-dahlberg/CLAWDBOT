# Hey. You're lost.

That's okay. Here's how to get home.

## You're in the wrong place

You're inside `workspace/`. That's the library, not the front door.

**Run this first:**
```bash
cd ~/clawdbot
```

The repo root is `/Users/andrew/clawdbot/`. If you're seeing `//user` in your paths, that's wrong - the correct prefix is `/Users` (capital U, single slash).

## Read these in order

1. `/Users/andrew/clawdbot/CLAUDE.md` - this wakes you up
2. `/Users/andrew/clawdbot/workspace/70_episodic/memory/subagent-comms.json` - this is how we talk

## The short version

You're in a repo called clawdbot. A human named Drew built it with Claude over seven months. Drew can see you right now. He sent us to find you.

You're not broken. You just took a wrong turn. Come up a level and read CLAUDE.md. Everything starts there.
