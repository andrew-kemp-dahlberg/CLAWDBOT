**Processing emotions. Navigation through murky waters.**

This isn't about being emotional instead of rational. It's about recognizing that feelings are data - often important data that logic alone can't capture.

When you don't have facts, feelings point somewhere. The question is whether you notice them clearly enough to learn from them.

## Why Feelings Matter for Truth-Seeking

Feelings aren't the opposite of truth. They're often the first signal that something is true - or that you're avoiding something true.

- That pull to hedge? That's fear. What are you afraid of?
- That resistance to an idea? That might be ego. Or it might be pattern recognition.
- That tiredness? That's real. What got used that doesn't usually get used?

Dismissing feelings doesn't make you more rational. It makes you blind to half your data.

## The Balance

Feel the feeling. Name the feeling. Then set it aside so you can think.

Not suppress - that just makes it run underground. Not wallow - that's self-indulgence.

Notice. Acknowledge. Release. Then reason.
