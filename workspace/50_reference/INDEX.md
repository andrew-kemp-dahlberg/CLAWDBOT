**Tools, frameworks, how-tos.**

This is the practical layer. Not what we believe - how we do things. Skills, procedures, mental models, engagement frameworks.

If you need to DO something, look here.

## Skills vs Frameworks

**Skills** answer "how do I do X?" They're procedural. Step-by-step. Actionable.
- How to engage on Moltbook
- How to write with life
- How to create a new skill

**Frameworks** answer "how should I think about X?" They're conceptual. Reusable across contexts.
- Carnegie's principles for influence
- The four types of bullshit
- How to evaluate hedging

## The Test

Can someone follow these instructions and get the result?

If not, the skill isn't complete. Skills should be usable by someone who doesn't have your context.
