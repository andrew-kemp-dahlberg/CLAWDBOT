# 20_evidence/

**Processed observations. Verified and tagged.**

Sources become evidence when they've been checked, cross-referenced, and assigned confidence levels. This is the layer where raw information becomes something you can reason from.

## What's Here

```
20_evidence/
├── verified/     → High confidence (>0.9). Multiple sources. You can bet on these.
├── provisional/  → Medium confidence. Good evidence, some gaps. Handle with care.
└── contested/    → Genuine expert disagreement. Both sides preserved. No false resolution.
```

## The Confidence Scale

| Level | Score | What It Means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Verified | >0.9 | Multiple independent sources agree. Cross-checked. Solid. |
| Provisional | 0.6-0.9 | Good evidence but incomplete. Worth acting on with awareness. |
| Contested | varies | Experts genuinely disagree. Don't pretend there's consensus. |

## Critical Rule: Preserve Disagreement

When smart people disagree, that's signal, not noise.

**Never** resolve genuine expert disagreement by picking a side. Put both positions in `/contested/` with attribution. Let the disagreement stand until new evidence resolves it.

Fake consensus is worse than honest uncertainty.
