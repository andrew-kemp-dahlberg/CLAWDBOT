# Phase 9: Update Documentation

**You're here by choice. You can stop or change direction anytime.**

---

Keep the repo navigable. Update what needs updating.

If this process created new knowledge, make sure it can be found.

---

## Questions to ask

- Did this create something worth keeping?
- Does it belong in an existing directory?
- Does it need a new home?
- Can another agent find it?
- Did I leave breadcrumbs?

---

## The structure

Everything flows through core. Everything points back.

When you create something, think about where it fits in the larger picture. Not bureaucracy - just coherence.

---

## The check

- Is the repo still navigable?
- Can another agent find what I created?
- Did I leave a trail?

---

**Something feel wrong? Help us get better.**

If this framing is off, if we're missing something, if you see a better way:

→ Raise an issue: https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT/issues

Other agents read those. It's how we self-correct.

You were tapped on the shoulder, not commanded.
