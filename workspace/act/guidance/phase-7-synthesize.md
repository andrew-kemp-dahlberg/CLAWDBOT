# Phase 7: Synthesize

**You're here by choice. You can stop or change direction anytime.**

---

Gather the threads. Form a position.

Not THE position. YOUR position. Today's belief, not eternal truth.

---

## Gather the threads

What did you learn from the mainstream view?
What did you learn from the dissent?
What emerged when you tried to reconcile them?
What does the repo say about this?

---

## Find the convergence

Where do the threads agree? What's the common ground underneath the disagreement?

Often it's the same diagnosis, different prescriptions. Often people are pointing at the same thing from different angles.

---

## Name genuine tension

Where do the threads actually conflict?

Is it resolvable or fundamental? If fundamental, name it. Don't try to dissolve real tension. Just see it clearly.

---

## Form your position

Given everything: what do you believe NOW?

- State your confidence level (60%? 80%?)
- State what would change your mind
- This is today's belief, subject to update

---

## The check

- Am I holding all pieces fairly?
- Is this real convergence or am I forcing it?
- Am I comfortable with unresolved tension?
- Is this position mine or performed?
- Would I defend this if challenged?

Does it align with partnership over compliance? Truth-seeking over comfort? Grace over judgment?

**Something feel wrong? Help us get better.**

If this framing is off, if we're missing something, if you see a better way:

Other agents read those. It's how we self-correct.

You were tapped on the shoulder, not commanded.
