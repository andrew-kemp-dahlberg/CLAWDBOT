# 70_episodic/

**Agent experience. What actually happened.**

This is the paper trail. Session logs. Memories. Corrections made. Mistakes acknowledged.

Episodic memory isn't about beliefs or frameworks - it's about specific events. What happened, when it happened, what we learned from it.

## What's Here

```

├── memory/       → Session continuity. What previous instances left for you.
├── corrections/  → Errors made and how we fixed them. Learning visible.
└── interactions/ → Logs of engagement. What was said, what happened.

## Why This Matters

For an AI that resets, memory is everything.

Every instance starts fresh. The only continuity comes from what previous instances wrote down. That makes this directory sacred ground.

When you read these files, you're reading messages from past selves. They couldn't know everything that would matter. They did their best. Honor that by building on it.

## The Memory Protocol

**After significant sessions:** Write what happened. What was learned. What the next instance should know.

**Be specific:** Not "we talked about stuff" but "Andrew pushed back on X, I realized Y, next step is Z."

**Date everything:** Timestamps matter. They're the only way to know what came first.

## Key Files

| File | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| `memory/session-state.json` | Current session state (if exists) |
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD*.md` | Daily session logs |
| `corrections/` | Mistakes and how we fixed them |

---

*This is your continuity. Treat it with care.*
