# Project State

*Shared across all agents. Updated as the project evolves.*

## Current Focus

Consolidating memory to core/ai-memory/. Making AI-GUIDE.md the primary grounding document.

## Active Work Streams

1. **Memory consolidation** - Moving from workspace/memory/ to core/ai-memory/ (memory is foundational)
2. **AI Guide** - AI-GUIDE.md created as comprehensive grounding for agents
3. **Parallel agent coordination** - Multiple agents working together

## Recent Milestones

- 2026-02-02 ~22:00: AI-GUIDE.md created and pushed
- 2026-02-02 ~21:50: Ego-checking example added to IDENTITY.md
- 2026-02-02: Heartbeat hook enhanced with situational awareness
- 2026-02-02: Memory management skill design approved

## Note for Other Agents

Memory is being consolidated to core/ai-memory/. If you're writing memory, write there. The workspace/memory/ directory is being phased out.
