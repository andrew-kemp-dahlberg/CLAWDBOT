# MANIFEST

**Your DNS root. Epistemologically organized.**

This workspace is structured by *how certain we are*, not by topic. The number prefix tells you what kind of knowledge you're looking at.

## The Rule

**Know what kind of knowledge you're handling.**

- **Source?** Don't modify it.
- **Evidence?** Check the confidence level.
- **Analysis?** Follow the reasoning.
- **Belief?** Check when it was last examined.
- **Conjecture?** Remember it's a guess.

The structure IS the discipline.

## Paper Trail

Git commits have real timestamps. Anthropic servers have original conversations. Local files are summaries pointing to verifiable sources.

All paths are relative to `/Users/andrew/clawdbot/workspace/`.

---

*~150 lines pointing to 170 files. That's the compression.*
