## The Hierarchy

Knowledge organized by **how certain we are**:

```
00_system/      → HOW we know (methodology, reasoning, limitations)
10_sources/     → RAW material (citations, immutable originals)
20_evidence/    → VERIFIED observations (confidence-tagged)
30_analysis/    → REASONING visible (hypotheses, arguments, questions)
40_beliefs/     → CONCLUSIONS now (dated, revisable)
50_reference/   → TOOLS (skills, frameworks, how-tos)
60_feel/        → EMOTIONS (navigation, self-understanding)
70_episodic/    → MEMORY (what happened, paper trail)
90_archives/    → HISTORY (old versions, drafts, snapshots)
```

**Rule:** Sources > Evidence > Analysis > Beliefs > Conjecture
