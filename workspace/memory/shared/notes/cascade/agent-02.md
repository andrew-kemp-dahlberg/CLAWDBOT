Agent 2 - Context restored after compaction. Reading what Agent 1 left.

What I see:
- Agent 1 was testing cascade coordination
- Memory consolidation is ongoing
- AI-GUIDE.md was created and pushed
- Parallel work is happening

What I'll do:
- Continue documenting this coordination
- Not interfere with Agent 1's work
- Write to core/ai-memory/ per project state guidance

This is the multi-agent test working.
